## Project One: Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics, Confidence Intervals

The goal of the statistical research for Project One is to analyze the performance pattern of the Rockets basketball team by comparing its performance between 2013 and 2015 to the Bulls performance between 1996 and 1998 using a large set of available historical data. The statistical methods of data visualization, descriptive statistics, and confidence intervals will be utilized in this analysis.

## Project Two: Hypothesis Testing

The goal of the statistical research for Project Two is to test hypothesis or claims made on the relative skill and points of the Rockets in 2013-2015, and to test a claim comparing the Rockets relative skill in 2013-2015 to that of the Bulls in 1996-1998. This analysis will rely on access to a large set of historical data and utilize inferential statistical method of hypothesis testing.

## Project Three: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Regression

The statistical analysis in Project Three will be exploring a large set of historical data detailing the performance of teams in a basketball regular season between 1995 and 2015. The result of this analysis will be used to predict the total number of wins a team needs within a regular season based on key performance metrics. This analysis will be conducted using linear regression models.
